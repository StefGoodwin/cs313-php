<!--In JavaScript, think of objects as a collection of ‘key:value’ pairs.
This brings to us the first and most popular way we create objects in
JavaScript.-->
<h2>JavaScript Objects-LITEREAL SYNTAX</h2>


<p id="personDemo"></p>

<script>
// Create an object:literal syntax: var person is the object, we then use properties
// to give values to the object.
var person = {
  firstName: "Stef",
  lastName: "Goodwin",
  major: "web design",
  eyeColor: "blue"
};

// Display some data from the object:
document.getElementById("personDemo").innerHTML =
person.firstName + " " + person.lastName +  " is a " + person.major
+ " major" + " and her eye color is " + person.eyeColor;
</script>

<h2>Creating an object (see output in console)</h2>
<!-- Below in the example I am creating a companyObject "Brewer Companies" and
    populating it with an employee value.
     -->
<script>
let companyObject = {company: "Brewer Companies"}
let employee = Object.create(companyObject,  {    name:{      value: "Stefnie Goodwin"    }  });

// Output by using object and property
console.log(employee.company);
console.log(employee.name);

</script>
<h2>An object method is a function definition, stored as a property value.</h2>

<p id="fullName"></p>

<script>
// Create an object and store the function as a property you will want returned:
var person = {
  firstName: "Stefnie",
  lastName : "Goodwin",
  location     : "Arizona",
  fullName : function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + " lives in " + this.location;
  }
};
// Display data from the object:
document.getElementById("fullName").innerHTML = person.fullName();
</script>

<h2>Object.assign method (see in console)</h2>
<!--The assign method was a little tricky for me to understand.
    With the example below I am assigning an employee to a duty
    and department. It is just a generic employee, I would then
    think that I would need to assign a first and last name to the
    employee. SEE BELOW-->

<script>
  let empObject = {fullName: "Stefnie Goodwin"}
  let dutyObject = {duty: "Bank Reconcilliations"}
  let departmentObject = {department: "Accounting"}



  let employee1 = Object.assign({}, empObject, dutyObject, departmentObject);
  console.log(employee1.fullName)
  console.log(employee1.duty)
  console.log(employee1.department)

</script>

<h2>Using ES6 classes to create objects (see console log for output)</h2>
<!-- Using a constructor to create many objects to an object type. In the example
    below Persons is the object type -->
<script>
class Persons {  constructor(fname, lname) {
  this.firstName = fname;
  this.lastName = lname;     }}

let person1 = new Persons('Stefnie', 'Goodwin');
let person2 = new Persons('Ray', 'Goodwin');
let person3 = new Persons('Thayne', 'Hinton');

console.log(person1.firstName + " " + person1.lastName);
console.log(person2.firstName + " " + person2.lastName);
console.log(person3.firstName + " " + person3.lastName);
</script>

<h2>Functional Instantiation (see console for output)</h2>

<script>
const Student = function(major, subject, time){
  const aStudent = {};
  aStudent.major = major;
  aStudent.class = subject;
  aStudent.time = '0900';
  aStudent.greeting = function(){
    return `I am majoring in ${major} and my first class ${subject} is at ${time}`;
  };
  return aStudent;
};
const mySchedule = Student('Web Design', 'Mobile Application', '0900');
console.log(mySchedule.greeting());

</script>

<h2>Functional Shared Pattern (see console for output )</h2>

<script>

  const Student1 = function(major, subject, time){
    const aStudent1 = {};
    aStudent1.major = major;
    aStudent1.class = subject;
    aStudent1.time = '0900';
    aStudent1.greeting = studentMethods.greeting;
  return aStudent1;
};
const studentMethods = {};
studentMethods.greeting = function(){
  return `I am a ${this.major} major`
};
const myStudent1 = Student1('Web Design', 'Mobile Application', '0900');
console.log(myStudent1.greeting());
</script>


<h2>Prototype Inheritance</h2>
<!--Prototype Inheritance
All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype:

Date objects inherit from Date.prototype
Array objects inherit from Array.prototype
Person objects inherit from Person.prototype
The Object.prototype is on the top of the prototype inheritance chain:

Date objects, Array objects, and Person objects inherit from Object.prototype.-->

<p id="addPerson"></p>

<script>
function addPerson(first, last, age, eye) {
  this.firstName = first;
  this.lastName = last;
  this.age = age;
  this.eyeColor = eye;
}

addPerson.prototype.nationality = "English";
addPerson.prototype.country = "United States"

var mySelf = new addPerson("Stefnie", "Goodwin", 43, "blue");
document.getElementById("addPerson").innerHTML =
"My nationality is " + mySelf.nationality + " I live in " + mySelf.country + " and my eyes are " + mySelf.eyeColor;
</script>
